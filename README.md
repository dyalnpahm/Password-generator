# Password-generator

## Description
The motivation of this project is to create a password generator that generates a 8 key password with special characters.

This project was build in order to create strong passwords that are hard to crack.

It helps those who are struggling to find a password which is strong.

I learnt how to use javascript in order to create random passwords that are usable by the consumer.
